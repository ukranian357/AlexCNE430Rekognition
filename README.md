Introduction
[AICO] will perform [image recognition analysis] for [RTC].
Purpose and objectives
The purpose of this project is to [deploy a automated software that has been trained using Amazon 
Rekognition training to distinguish with high accuracy recognition of objects clients require without 
manual sorting to establish convenience for the client]. The project objective is to deliver to the client a 
high accuracy image recognition model they can easily deploy by simply going to a http address and 
using a user friendly interface to accomplish object distinction the client requires
Tasks
[AICO] will complete the following tasks as part of this project:
Create SOW
Create a Amazon Rekognition Model
Train the Rekognition Model using client requirements ( train the model to analyze different faces, 
different car types depending on client need per project .
Test Rekognition Model until a 90 percent match is confirmed
Deploy Stack on AWS from original source for template using Acantril’s work (learn-cantrill-io-labs/awspet-rekognition-ecr at master · acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs · GitHub)
Create Amazon Elastic Container within the Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Create a Docker Image
Create Elastic Container Service
Page2
Test Application by going to correct http address and checking if the model is up and running and able to 
take requests for match analysis of objects
Deploy application online
The following tasks are not included in this project’s scope and will not be performed by [AICO]
Covering expenses for anything but on demand serverless deployment on Amazon
Project will only be activated when client creates request which will result in Amazon Rekognition Model 
being activated for a specified period of time so client can test batches of images for match analysis 
Deliverables
[AICO] will provide the following deliverables as part of this project:
Amazon Rekognition Model trained on client product for match recognition
Deploy Stack on AWS 
Amazon Elastic Container within the Amazon Elastic Container Registry
a Docker Image
a Amazon Elastic Cluster

[Create Final Product 
with clean webpage 
with elegant front end 
appearance. Test web 
page for no errors. Do a 
final training and 
testing on Rekognition 
model to ensure a high 
accuracy is obtained in 
object comparison by 
providing new fresh 
data sets to the Model 
for training and testing]
